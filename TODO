FEATURES:

- kurtosis and skew
- better time series (avg, moving avg, exponential smoothing, Holt's linear trend, ... dropping high and low)
- momentum as a streak
- fourier transform

- Power transformer instead of my own
- discretization / binning (KBins or Quantile transformer)
- rank transform (scipy.stats.rankdata)

- kalman filter
- Elo rating

ENSEMBLE:

- multiple runs with different seeds
- train over multiple years to make final hyperparameter selections

ANALYSIS:

- significance test for telling if a model is better than another
- confidence intervals for final model
- look at forcing more predictions up or down

type I type II error?

final model needs to be without CV
bring back my own CV for one model?


if the 95% confidence intervals of the accuracies of two models do not overlap, we can reject the null 
hypothesis that the performance of both classifiers is equal at a confidence level of Î±=0.05 (or 5% probability)
