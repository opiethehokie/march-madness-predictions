PREPROCESSING:

- synthesize games by adjusting stats

FEATURES:

- fourier transform
- kurtosis and skew
- discretization / binning (KBins or Quantile transformer)
- rank transform (scipy.stats.rankdata)
- Power transformer instead of my own
- better time series (avg, moving avg, exponential smoothing, Holt's linear trend, ... dropping high and low)
- momentum as a streak
- revisit diff transformer, it should be useful
- kalman filter
- Elo rating
- just points for my ratings to reduce complexity

ENSEMBLE:

- multiple runs with different seeds
- train over multiple years to make final hyperparameter selections

ANALYSIS:

- significance test for telling if a model is better than another
- confidence intervals for final model
