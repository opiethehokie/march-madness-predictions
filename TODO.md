## Future Ideas

* stacking model doesn't contribute anything unique, try bringing back a regression on (capped?) margin of victory model
* genetic programming model

* monte carlo simulation for reaching round percentages
* bayesian simulation for incorporating seeds into filled out bracket

* new features from other data sources
* new features (elo?) for multi-year performance of coaches
* tweak existing stats features based on what's currently most important
