## Future Ideas

* check stats against stats book
* confidence intervals could be bootstrap method (varying year) instead of testing distribution, vary seed, 30 total
* statistical power to check if enough samples

* removing outliers should be in pipeline
* stacking model doesn't contribute anything unique, try bringing back a regression on (capped?) margin of victory model
* genetic programming model
* remove correlated features from manual (if better retry PowerTransformer), chi2?
* scaling should happen before PCA
* try EnsembleVoteClassifier in place of or in addition to stacking

* monte carlo simulation for reaching round percentages
* bayesian simulation for incorporating seeds into filled out bracket

* new features (elo?) for multi-year performance (might find good coaches even though players are turning over)
* tweak existing features based on what's currently most important
